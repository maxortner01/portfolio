# Racing Game Dashboard

This program comes in two versions: the game version, and the no game version. The program displays a 2D graphical dashboard of a car. It links to most modern racing games using a localhost based UDP protocol and retrieves all the current statistics of the game such as speed, RPM, pedal position, car telemetry, and compiles it onto a visual dashboard. The no game version will boot up and render a dashboard without requiring any input, while the other version has a launcher for you to choose a dashboard and launches with the game.
