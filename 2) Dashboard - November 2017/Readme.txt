This program was written in python to communicate to the localhost tcp output of modern racing games in order to provide a secondary graphical interface that is synced to the current game.

The No Game Required folder contains the launcher that opens the dash directly, even when a game is not running. I later added support for different dashes, so I needed a UI to choose between them.
Thus the final version came along where there is a little launcher where you can choose the game (or it'll run immediately when a game opens).
