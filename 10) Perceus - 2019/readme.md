# Perceus

Perceus is my ongoing project that is now in its third iteration. It is aimed to be a 3D Game Engine, but at the moment serves its purpose as a 3D rendering engine. The main selling point is its completely
api-abstract architecture. The engine doesn't have any popular rendering framework's code built it. Instead it has a layer of abstraction that allows you to implement your own rendering api.
