# First 3D Engine

After my previous attempts in 3D graphics, I finally moved from the theory and into practice. This was the first time I stream-lined my OpenGL usage as well. This time I focused on memory management in
terms of objects that needed to be rendered, as well as using polymorphism to expand the capabilities of the engine. This was the first time I was able to move passed boiler-plate rendering code and focus on more over-arching things like infinite world generation and conservation of memory.
