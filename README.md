# Portfolio Overview

## 10K Program - June 2017

Language: Python

This program was created to easily retrieve 10K documents from the SEC’s website. It works by inputting a company ticker and will retrieve and download the last five years of 10K documents from SEC.gov.

## Dashboard - November 2017

Language: Python

This program comes in two versions: the game version, and the no game version.  The program displays a2D graphical dashboard of a car. It links to most modern racing games using a localhost based UDP protocol and retrieves all the current statistics of the game such as speed, RPM, pedal position, car telemetry, and compiles it onto a visual dashboard.  The no game version will boot up and render a dashboard without requiring any input,  while the other version has a launcher for you to choose a dashboard and launches with the game.

## Simulation Interface - November 2017

Language: Python

Coupled with the last program, this program compiles data from modern racing games the same way, but this UI is oriented more towards applications in a physical simulation.  Therefore, the data is positional data that could be translated for use in actuators that mimic the movement of the car.

## First Python 3D Renderer - April 2018

Language: Python

Controls: W, A, S, D to move around and mouse to pan the camera

This was my first attempt at rendering 3D points onto a 2D surface.  I had several epiphanies during this time that led to a greater understanding of 3D graphics.

## First 3D Graphics in C++ - May 2018

Language: C++ 

At  last,  I  moved  from  Python  into  C++  to  which  I  have  remained  to  this  day.   After  getting  an understanding of basic 3D graphics concepts, I decided to move them over to C++.  I learned to parse 3D object files and render them at the lowest level.

## First 3D Rendering Engine - June 2018

Language: C++

Controls: W, A, S, D to move around and mouse to pan the camera

After my previous attempts in 3D graphics, I finally moved from the theory and into practice. This was the first time I stream-lined my OpenGL usage as well.  This time I focused on memory management in terms of objects that needed to be rendered, as well as using polymorphism to expand the capabilities of the engine.

## Differential Fields - September 2018

Language: Python

My  interests  during  this  part  of  my  life  drifted  from  programming  into  mathematics,  then  back  to programming when I found a mathematical application for some programming.  I made a simple python script  to  render  fields  defined  by  a  differential equation,  and  used  the  created  vector  fields  to  simulate particles moving in a closed system.

## 2D Poker Game - October 2018

Language: C++

Controls: Space to end turn

After doing 3D graphics for a while, I took a small break and started focusing my efforts on understanding an efficient architecture for a graphics engine (which is arguably the most important part). Thus came a basic architecture I continue to use for smooth animations.

## 3D Graphing - February 2019

Language: C++

Controls: W, A, S, D to move around and mouse to pan the camera

I had too  much fun  doing  the  2D graphing  that  I  extended it  in  the  3D realm  with  my then  second iteration of my 3D rendering engine I called Ansel.  It allows you to make a 2D or 3D equation and graph it in a 3D environment as well as construct 3D shapes that are defined by equations.

## Perceus - 2019

Language: C++

Perceus is my ongoing project that is now in its third iteration.  It is aimed to be a 3D Game Engine, but at the moment serves its purpose as a 3D rendering engine.  The main selling point is its completely api-abstract architecture.  The engine doesn’t have any popular rendering framework’s code built it.  Instead it has a layer of abstraction that allows you to implement your own rendering api.
